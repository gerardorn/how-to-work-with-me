# A user's guide to working with me

## Things I do that may annoy you
- **Losing focus:** Sometimes when I deep dive in a topic, I end up investigating related subjects thoroughly. If you find me wandering off please remind me of my current goal
- **Delaying to deliver:** If a task doesn't seem challenging to me, I might take a while to complete it or even never deliver :confused:. This might be a risk for the team so if I've taken a while to finish a task, please ask me to be honest about it
- **Saying I don't remember:** I honestly struggle to remember things. At work I depend very hard on task tracking tools. If you need something from me, please make sure I write it down or create a ticket / issue and asign it to me
- **Using bad words:** It is never personal or to insult. If you ask me to avoid them, I'll do my best
